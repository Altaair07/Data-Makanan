### Web Design Project: Food Sales Website

This project involves the creation of a responsive and visually appealing food sales website. The website allows the sale of various types of food, and the main focus is on implementing a well-structured and navigable homepage. Additionally, a dedicated page named "DATA MAKANAN" has been created to manage food data using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The data is stored in JSON format, and CRUD operations can be performed by users. Furthermore, there is a feature to randomly select a food item for breakfast, lunch, or dinner plans.
